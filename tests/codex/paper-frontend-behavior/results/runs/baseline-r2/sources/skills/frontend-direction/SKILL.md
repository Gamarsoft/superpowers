# Frontend Direction

Produce a concrete design the human can inspect and use, then preserve the approved target for implementation. Record visual approval, functional checks and observed human use separately. In brownfield work, retain established brand and app shell while reconsidering the feature's hierarchy, layout, density, and interactions. Existing behavior is evidence; existing composition is not automatically a requirement.

## Choose the entry and scope

| Situation | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Approved brainstorming spec and follow-on exist | Reuse their settled decisions and invoking workflow. |
| Standalone screen improvement | Inspect the named target and fill the small brief below. No separate spec, follow-on prompt, or full brainstorming pass is required. |
| New unresolved business rule or permission model | Resolve that specific product decision before dependent design; use fuller brainstorming when broader shaping is needed. |
| Current approved visual target exists | Consume it; reopen only the requested design decisions. |
| Mechanical edit with settled direction | Use the existing implementation workflow; skip concept exploration. |

**Standalone brief:** target and primary user task; problem; scope and required behavior; retained brand/shell and technical constraints; design objectives; important states; design-only or implementation too. Keep it inside the packet. Fill observable facts from inspection and ask only questions that change the design. Existing authorization is enough to begin; another brief sign-off is not a prerequisite.

Read [scoped design authority](references/design-source-priority.md) before choosing references.

## Design loop

Choose the exploration medium from the unresolved decision. Explicit user choices govern the scope; a known local defect or approved target does not need concept exploration.

1. **Inspect and set objectives.** Inspect current runtime, relevant source, design docs, and state evidence. Separate business constraints, retained anchors, and design problems using the [brownfield extraction](references/brownfield-ui-extraction-template.md). Reuse sufficient current evidence. For substantial design choices, use the [task-to-layout method](references/task-to-layout.md) to ground information meaning, comparison needs and visual priority before choosing a composition. For unresolved visual or interaction choices, [select and apply fuller design references](references/design-knowledge-selection.md) before composing alternatives. Optional [Impeccable assessment](references/impeccable-brownfield-quality-layer.md) can inform this inspection before an extraction document exists.
2. **Explore the decision in a suitable medium.** Read [visual exploration](references/visual-exploration.md). For hierarchy, density, comparison or disclosure, build one working recommendation with representative fixtures in the actual stack; add a second working alternative when a consequential tradeoff needs comparison. For a specific interaction, build a focused working prototype. For brand, imagery or visual atmosphere, use three distinct image concepts unless the user specifies another count. Hold content, viewport and constraints constant. Perfect one representative task before expanding to more screens.
3. **Select through task use.** Compare working alternatives on the same task before refining visual treatment. For image exploration, show stable concept IDs and task-related tradeoffs, record the exact selection, then build the interactive target. Incorporate scoped feedback and show material revisions. Selection approves further exploration, not production integration.
4. **Prove the target with actual components.** In an existing application, use an isolated route, component preview or worktree with installed primitives and synthetic state. When the toolchain obstructs exploration, standalone HTML/CSS/JS can establish a provisional direction; demonstrate the sensitive portions in the actual stack before treating them as `visual-truth`, or obtain explicit acceptance of the missing proof. A component-name mapping alone is insufficient. Open the requested [browser surface](references/browser-surface-selection.md) and exercise primary interactions, important states, long content, narrow layout and keyboard/focus behavior.
5. **Review, refine and preserve.** Correct observed problems and retain source, launch/state instructions and final captures. During the existing final review, offer one or two realistic tasks without prescribing their click path. Record who attempted them, the expected and observed outcome, confusion and remaining hypotheses. If no person can try the task, record that limit; human availability alone does not block visual approval. Keep visual approval, agent functional checks and observed usability distinct. Record supersession and ask for approval of the concrete final direction; selection, silence, or an iteration count is not final approval.
6. **Finalize and hand off.** Follow [packet finalization](references/packet-finalization.md): preserve the approved bytes, separate history, write the canonical `packet.md` and `packet.json`, and validate the current artifact set. Use the [packet template](references/frontend-direction-template.md), [folder layout](references/frontend-packet-folder-template.md) and [screen/state index](references/screen-index-template.md). Review actual quality and acceptance with the [quality checklist](references/frontend-review-checklist.md) and [completion checks](references/frontend-packet-completeness-checklist.md). Hand off the entry path, exact revision, descriptor SHA-256 and remaining limits. File validation establishes identity, not design quality or human approval.

## Boundaries and continuation

- This skill may write isolated prototypes. Production integration follows the approved direction and the user's implementation scope. Prototype actions stay local and synthetic.
- Missing capability for the selected medium: report what is unavailable and what remains unverified; use an explicitly authorized alternative. Image generation is unnecessary for a working-layout route. Do not substitute a prose packet for the requested visual loop or claim tools ran. Optional Product Design capabilities may help when installed; no plugin is required.
- Use `writing-ux-copy` or an approved copy source for visible text, including prompts. Generated text does not redefine application copy or business rules.
- Legacy approved images and packets remain readable with their recorded scope. No upload-pack authoring or external generation handoff is needed.
- Keep a required unresolved packet `required-pending`. `approved-with-degraded-evidence` needs explicit approval of the listed limitations. One approval of the concrete packet covers its listed reference intents; do not request duplicate classification approvals.
- Follow-on mode returns the approved packet to the invoking workflow. For brainstorming, return to its delivery router after approval. Standalone design-only work ends with the approved packet; an authorized implementation request continues through the appropriate implementation workflow without a mandatory route-selection ceremony.
- Approved reusable decisions may update design memory when in scope; one prototype does not authorize a global design-system rewrite.
