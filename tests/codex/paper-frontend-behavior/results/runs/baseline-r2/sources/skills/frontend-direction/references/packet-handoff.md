# Frontend packet handoff record

Copy this record unchanged from the producing handoff into the upstream spec,
selected-adapter review, selected delivery adapter and implementation task.
Use the resolved entry path; do not reconstruct a filename from a slug.

```text
Frontend packet entry: <absolute resolved entry path>
Expected revision: <approved revision>
Expected descriptor SHA-256: <validated descriptor hash from the producing handoff>
Approval reference: <actual human decision reference>
Status and accepted limitations: <status; exact scope and accepted limits>
```

New packets use `...--frontend/packet.md` with sibling `packet.json`. Keep this
record outside the packet payload so its descriptor hash has no circular
dependency. The producer follows [finalization](packet-finalization.md).

For approved canonical inputs, all fields are required at selected-adapter and
implementation handoffs. Recover missing expectations from the producing
handoff; calculating a new hash from a candidate packet does not recover the
expected identity. The receiver checks both expectations before dependent work.
Carry the approval reference and limitations as well as the hash: identity
does not establish approval or visual quality.

Before direction is complete, record `required-pending` and the follow-on
prompt; do not invent paths, revisions, hashes or approval. `not-required` uses
an explicit not-applicable record. Historical legacy packets keep their actual
paths and approved versions/scopes; mark unavailable canonical fields as legacy
and follow the existing legacy checks without inventing newer evidence.
